          <h1>Structure and Interpretation of <nobr>Deep Networks</nobr></h2>
          <p>Deep networks program themselves by finding patterns in data.
          But what patterns do they find,
          and what programs do they learn?
          Large-scale machine learning presents computer science researchers
          and practitioners with a new problem: how to understand, apply,
          and improve complex programs that were not designed explicitly
          by a human programmer.
          </p>
          <p>In this IAP practicum, we introduce the problem of
          interpreting deep networks.  We will not focus on training.
          Rather, we our topic is the art of how to understand a network
          after it is trained.  We examine both local
          (single-case) and global (over-a-distribution) methods for
          understanding a network's behavior.

          <p>Every class will be a practicum, built around an interactive
          lab where you will learn to apply explanation methods using
          real models and data.  Interpretable machine learning is a quickly
          evolving area, and each class will be built around recent papers,
          and will be led by researchers who are active in the area.

          <h1>Prerequisites</h1>

          <p>The course assumes familiarity with basic machine learning,
          neural networks, and python.  An introductory machine learning
          course or a deep network course such as S.191 should be enough.
          You should have previous experience training models; this class
          is not mainly about learning to train models, but about
          understanding trained models.
          </p>


          <h1>Syllabus</h1>
          <h2>1. Introduction: Why care how?</h2>
          <p>Does it matter whether we understand what a
          deep network is doing or not, if the results look good?
          Isn't accuracy on the holdout set the ultimate goal?

          <h2>2. Explaining predictions.</h2>
          <p>What part of the input does a model look at?  What can
          we learn from this?

          <h2>3. Explaining models.</h2>
          <p>How does a neural network decompose data internally?  What can
          we learn from a model's representation?

          <h2>4. Adversaries and interpretability.</h2>
          <p>Recent findings suggest that adversarial robustness may
          lead to more interpretable models.  We discuss and experiment with
          this effect.
